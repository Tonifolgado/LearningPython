# LearningPython

Compilation of examples about how to use Python for development.

This repository contains a series of Python files demonstrating various concepts and features of the Python programming language. It also includes Jupyter notebooks that consolidate these examples for easier learning and experimentation.

## Python Learning Files

The following Python files cover different topics:

*   `01PythonBasics.py`: Basic syntax, data types, variables, and comments.
*   `01bOperators.py`: Arithmetic, logical, and other Python operators.
*   `02VariablesStrings.py`: In-depth look at variables and string manipulations.
*   `03ListTupleSetDict.py`: Working with Python's built-in data structures.
*   `04ConditionalLoopFunction.py`: Control flow (if/else, loops) and functions.
*   `05ClassesModulesExceptions.py`: Object-Oriented Programming, modules, and exception handling.
*   `05bGenerators.py`: Understanding and using generators.
*   `05bModules.py`: More on creating and using modules.
*   `06Dates.py`: Working with dates and times.
*   `07Challenges.py`: Common programming challenges and their solutions in Python.
*   `08LambdasOtherfuncions.py`: Lambda functions and other functional programming concepts.
*   `09FileHandling.py`: Reading from and writing to files.
*   `09FileProcessHandling.py`: Interacting with the file system and processes.
*   `10RegularExpressions.py`: Using regular expressions for pattern matching.
*   `11BuiltInFunctions.py`: Overview of useful built-in Python functions.

## Jupyter Notebooks

*   `PythonLearning0.ipynb`: This notebook compiles the code from `01PythonBasics.py` through `11BuiltInFunctions.py` into a single document. Each Python script is presented in its own cell, preceded by a markdown cell indicating the original filename. This allows for easy execution and exploration of the examples.
*   `PythonLearning1.ipynb`: (You might want to add a description for this notebook if it exists and is relevant)
*   `PythonLearning2.ipynb`: (You might want to add a description for this notebook if it exists and is relevant)
*   `MatplotlibWorks.ipynb`: (You might want to add a description for this notebook if it exists and is relevant)


## How to Use

You can clone this repository and run the Python files individually using a Python interpreter (e.g., `python 01PythonBasics.py`).

Alternatively, you can open and run the Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook. This is a good way to interactively explore the code examples. Ensure you have Jupyter installed (`pip install jupyterlab notebook`).
